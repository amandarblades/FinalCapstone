# Final Capstone

This directory contains all of the starter projects for the final capstone.

Each project contains instructions that provides information about the starting code and explains how to get started with the final capstone project.

Created with  a team of four, a product owner, and help from instructors. I had the most involvement in the IntelliJ portion of the project.
